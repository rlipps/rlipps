### Hello!

My name is Ryan Lipps. I'm new to GitHub and am excited to learn. I'm a member of the UVA MSDS class of 2024 so stay posted on all of the cool projects I'll have in here. Until then, here's a little bit about me:
- I love music and play guitar
- I love soccer and play often
- I love making and drinking coffee
